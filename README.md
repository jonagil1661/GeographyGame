This program utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript serves as a game where the user can test their knowledge of country/territory flags. The user has the option 
to guess the given flag (and gain a point), guess the country multiple times (wihtout losing any points), and skip the given flag if unable to guess (therefore
losing a point). 

This program makes use of the Restcountries API: https://restcountries.com/
PNG images, offical country names, and common country names are put into a javascript array. A random country is chosen from this array; the flag is shown, and 
the user may enter either the official or common name to earn the point.
